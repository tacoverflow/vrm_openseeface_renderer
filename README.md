# VRM OPENSEEFACE RENDERER

A humble attempt to try to render a VRM object following the openseeface input.
Similar to the vseeface program, but simpler and using web technologies (so I don't have to worry about Unity and cross platform problems).

This is an **Electron** based application that can run on Windows, Mac and Linux.
It also uses the **three-vrm** library to render the 3d models.
